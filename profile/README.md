Welcome to the github instance for GLFHC. This project contains tutorials and other useful tools for using github and git within GLFHC.

## Tutorials
For those unfamiliar with using git or github, or are new to Source Code Control Systems in general, I strongly recommend viewing the tutorials on how to best utilize 
git in your work. Tutorials can be found [here](tutorials/getting_started.md)
