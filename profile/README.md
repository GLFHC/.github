## Introduction
Welcome to the github instance for GLFHC. This project contains tutorials and other useful tools for using github and git within GLFHC.

For those unfamiliar with using git or github, or are new to Source Code Control Systems in general, I strongly recommend viewing the tutorials on how to best utilize 
git in your work. Tutorials can be found [here](tutorials/getting_started.md)
